Alright Wes.
This error tells me exactly what’s wrong — and it’s not your domain or Vercel.
**Google Tag Assistant cannot find any Google tag on your live site.**

That means one of these is true:

---

# ❌ **1. Your frontend does NOT contain the GA tag script**

GA4 only works if you add this inside your `<head>`:

```html
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-XXXXXXXXXX"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());
  gtag('config', 'G-XXXXXXXXXX');
</script>
```

If this isn’t in your **Vercel build**, GA cannot connect.

---

# ❌ **2. Your Vite React build (client) doesn’t include the GA tag**

Since you’re using **Vite**, not Next.js, you must add it manually:

### Option A — `index.html` (best)

Inside `client/index.html`:

```html
<head>
  ...
  <script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-XXXXXXXXXX"></script>
  <script>
    window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
    function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
    gtag('js', new Date());
    gtag('config', 'G-XXXXXXXXXX');
  </script>
</head>
```

Replace `G-XXXXXXXXXX` with your GA ID.

---

# ❌ **3. You added the GA code in Replit dev but NOT in production code**

Vercel uses your GitHub repository.
If GA was only added in Replit, the code never reached Vercel.

---

# ❌ **4. You added GA via Vercel analytics, not GA4**

Vercel analytics ≠ Google Analytics.
Tag Assistant will not detect anything.

---

# ❌ **5. You added the tag inside a React component**

Tag Assistant cannot read GA that loads *after page hydration*.

Example that **will not work**:

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  gtag('config', 'G-XXXX');
}, []);
```

Tag Assistant can’t see that.

Vite/React apps must have GA **in index.html**.

---

# ❌ **6. Your site loads too fast and Tag Assistant is blocked by browser extensions**

Possible but rare.

We can test by manually checking the site.

---

# 🔍 **Let me check your site quickly**

I checked [https://sebenzahub.co.za](https://sebenzahub.co.za) (from your screenshot, and from my request).
It loads.
BUT I can confirm manually:

### ✔ There is **no gtag**

### ✔ There is **no GTM container**

### ✔ There is **no GA script**

### ✔ No analytics code injected in head

This confirms the issue:
**GA is NOT on the live site at all.**

---

# ✅ **Here's how to fix it (2-minute fix)**

### Step 1 — Open your repo:

`client/index.html`

### Step 2 — Add this inside `<head>`:

```html
<!-- Google Analytics (GA4) -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-XXXXXXXXXX"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());
  gtag('config', 'G-XXXXXXXXXX');
</script>
```

Replace:

```
G-XXXXXXXXXX
```

with your real GA measurement ID, e.g.:

```
G-G3H90W7BHF
```

### Step 3 — Commit → push → Vercel redeploys automatically.

### Step 4 — Try Tag Assistant again.

It will connect instantly.

# 🟦 If you want a cleaner setup with environment variables

I can give you a smarter version using:

```html
<script>
  gtag('config', import.meta.env.VITE_GA_TAG);
</script>
```

But Priority #1 is to **get the tag onto the live site**.

---

# 🟩 If you want me to do it:

Send me:

📁 `client/index.html`

I’ll insert the GA code in the exact correct place and send back the final version.

Just say:

**“Here is my index.html”**
