Short answer.
**No — Google Analytics (GA4) doesn’t let you “import” events as a bulk file.**
But… you *can* set it up so GA instantly recognises all these events the moment they fire, and you can pre-configure the dashboards, custom dimensions, and reports so everything is ready.

Let me break down what’s possible so you don’t waste time.

---

# ✅ What you *can’t* do

GA4 **does not** support:

* Uploading a JSON/YAML of events
* Importing a full event plan
* Creating events in bulk through the UI
* Pre-registering events before they fire

So there’s no “import event plan” button.
GA only learns events once your site sends them.

---

# ✅ What *is* possible (and how teams actually do this)

Here’s how you get 100% of the benefits of an “import,” without GA actually supporting bulk upload.

## **1. Fire each event once → GA automatically registers it**

GA automatically creates an event definition the moment your site sends it *one time*.

You can trigger them manually with a script:

```js
gtag('event', 'job_viewed', {test: true});
gtag('event', 'cv_uploaded', {test: true});
gtag('event', 'job_post_created', {test: true});
...
```

Once GA sees them:

* they appear in **Configure → Events**
* you can toggle “Mark as conversion”
* you can build dashboards with them

You only need to fire them *once* — you don’t have to wait for real users.

---

## **2. Pre-create custom dimensions for your parameters**

GA *does* let you bulk-prepare the “parameters” (user_id, job_id, company_id, etc).

You add these in:

**Admin → Custom Definitions → Create Custom Dimension**

Example:

* Name: `job_id`
* Scope: event
* Parameter: `job_id`

You can create all of them upfront:

* user_id
* role
* job_id
* company_id
* candidate_id
* source
* filters
* device
* duration_sec
* error_code

This is the closest thing GA allows to a “bulk import.”

---

## **3. Pre-build dashboards that will automatically populate**

You can create dashboards in GA before events exist.

When events start flowing:

* widgets fill in
* graphs populate
* funnels show data

So you can have your:

* Candidate Funnel
* Recruiter Funnel
* Job Browsing reports
* Application Flow
* Platform Usage dashboards

ready on day one.

---

## **4. Use GTM (Google Tag Manager) if you want easier naming control**

If you prefer config-over-code, you can push everything via GTM:

* All event names
* All parameters
* All triggers

GA still won’t “import” them.
But GTM acts like a central control panel for your entire tracking plan.

---

# ⭐ If you want, I can generate a **“GA Quick-Register Script”**

A single script you run *once* that fires every event:

```ts
const events = [
  "signup_started",
  "signup_completed",
  "login_success",
  "profile_started",
  "profile_completed",
  "cv_uploaded",
  "cv_parsed",
  ...
];

events.forEach(e => {
  gtag('event', e, {seed: true});
});
```

This forces GA to register all your events instantly.

If you want this script, tell me:
**“Give me the GA quick-register script.”**
