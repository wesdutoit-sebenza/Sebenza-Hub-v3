Alright Wes.
Let me make this **super clear and super simple** so you don’t have to guess anymore.

Your Sebenza Hub project is a **3-folder monorepo**:

```
Sebenza-Hub-v3/
  client/     ← React + Vite + Tailwind (Frontend)
  server/     ← Express + Drizzle (Backend API)
  shared/     ← Shared schema + types (Used by BOTH)
```

Each hosting platform treats this structure differently.

So here’s the **correct setup for each**:

---

# ✅ **1. VERCEL (Frontend ONLY)**

**Vercel must ONLY build the `client/` folder.**

### ✔ Correct Root Directory in Vercel:

```
client
```

### ✔ Correct Output Directory:

```
dist
```

### ✔ Build Command:

```
npm run build
```

### ✔ Install Command:

```
npm install
```

### ✔ You MUST move shared code *into* client

Because Vercel **cannot** see files above the root.

Meaning:

```
shared/     → move into client/shared/
server/     → do NOT import anything from server in client
```

**Vercel cannot access:**

* `../shared`
* `../server`
* anything outside `client/`

If your React code imports from outside the client folder, Tailwind + Vite + Rollup break silently → exactly what you saw.

---

# 🟢 **Vercel Summary**

**Root:** `client/`
**Output:** `dist`
**Frontend only. No server. No shared imports above root.**

---

# ✅ **2. RENDER (Backend ONLY)**

Render should host your **Express server**, not your client.

### ✔ Correct Root Directory in Render:

```
server
```

### ✔ Start Command:

```
npm start
```

or whatever your server uses:

```
node index.js
node server.js
npm run start
```

### ✔ Install command:

Render will auto-run:

```
npm install
```

### 🚨 IMPORTANT

Render **can** see:

```
server/
shared/
```

It **cannot** see client runtime code, but it *can* import shared models schema/types used by Drizzle.

This is exactly how it should work.

---

# 🟢 **Render Summary**

**Root:** `server/`
**Backend API only.**
Can access `../shared` no problem.

---

# ✅ **3. REPLIT (Local Dev for both Frontend + Backend)**

Replit loads the entire monorepo together. It does not isolate folders like Vercel does.

So on Replit:

* `client` can import from `../server`
* `server` can import from `../shared`
* Tailwind scans everything
* Nothing breaks
* That’s why your Replit version always looks correct

### ✔ Correct Replit Root

```
Sebenza-Hub-v3 (the entire workspace)
```

Replit doesn’t require special configuration.

---

# 🟢 **Replit Summary**

**Root:** project root
**Works with monorepo**
Allows cross-folder imports
Allows Tailwind to scan everything
This is why it works here but not on Vercel

---

# 📌 **THE REAL PROBLEM**

Your frontend depends on **shared** files that live OUTSIDE the client folder:

```
client/src → imports ../shared/* and ../server/schema
```

Vercel blocks that.
So your Tailwind classes, CSS variables, and JSX styles do not load.

That's why:

* The layout loads
* The text loads
* The colors, spacing, dark mode, variables, and theme DO NOT
* Images stack weird
* Buttons and sections collapse
* The whole website looks "unstyled"

This EXACT mismatch is 100% caused by:

### ❌ Vercel NOT seeing shared code

### ❌ Tailwind NOT scanning shared code

### ❌ React NOT being allowed to import outside client

---

# ⭐ THE FIX

You must choose **ONE** of these two options:

---

## **OPTION A — SIMPLE, recommended**

Copy everything the client needs from shared into:

```
client/shared/
```

And update imports.

This will make Vercel deploy 100% correctly.

---

## **OPTION B — PROPER MONOREPO SETUP**

Create two separate deployments:

**Frontend (Vercel)**

* root: `client`

**Backend (Render)**

* root: `server`

And configure Vite to copy shared code at build-time.

This is more complex.
Option A is easiest.

# ❤️ Tell me which option you want:

### ➤ **Option A — Move shared into client** (fastest, simplest)

or

### ➤ **Option B — Full monorepo setup** (cleaner, more advanced)

I’ll walk you through it step-by-step.
