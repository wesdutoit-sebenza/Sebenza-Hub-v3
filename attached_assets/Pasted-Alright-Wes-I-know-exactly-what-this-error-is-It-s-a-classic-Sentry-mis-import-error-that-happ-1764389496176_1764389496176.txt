Alright Wes. I know exactly what this error is.
It’s a **classic Sentry mis-import** error that happens when using **Vite** or **Next.js App Router** with the wrong Sentry import.

Your error says:

```
Rollup failed to resolve import "@sentry/react"
from "src/lib/sentry.ts"
```

This tells me **the wrong Sentry package is being imported**.

Let me break it down cleanly.

---

# ❌ What went wrong

You (or the Sentry wizard) added a file somewhere like:

```
src/lib/sentry.ts
```

And inside it, there is a line like:

```ts
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";
```

**BUT:**
With **Next.js + Sentry v8**, the correct package is:

```
@sentry/nextjs
```

NOT:

```
@sentry/react
```

Vercel + Next.js uses **Next.js–specific wrappers**, not the React SDK.

---

# ✅ How to fix it

## **Step 1 — Find the file causing the error**

Go to:

```
/src/lib/sentry.ts
```

(or whatever file the error mentions)

Look for:

```ts
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";
```

or:

```ts
import { init } from "@sentry/react";
```

---

## **Step 2 — Replace it with the correct import**

Change this:

```ts
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";
```

to this:

```ts
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";
```

That’s the correct SDK for Next.js.

# 📌 IMPORTANT!!!

### In Next.js 13/14 App Router, you **must NOT** write your own `sentry.ts` file.

Sentry auto-creates:

* `sentry.client.config.ts`
* `sentry.server.config.ts`
* `sentry.edge.config.ts` (sometimes)

You should **not** create additional Sentry initialization files manually unless you know what you’re doing.

If you created `src/lib/sentry.ts` after following a generic tutorial, delete it.
Next.js already handles initialization automatically through the wizard-generated configs.

---

# 🟢 The safe fix (recommended)

### **Delete the custom Sentry file** (`src/lib/sentry.ts`)

Then rely only on the auto-generated files:

```
sentry.client.config.ts
sentry.server.config.ts
next.config.mjs  (wrapped with withSentryConfig)
```

This fixes 99% of these build errors.

---

# 🟦 Why the error happened

Vercel uses **Vite** for parts of the build pipeline.
Vite/Rollup cannot resolve `@sentry/react` because:

* you are not running a plain React app
* the Sentry wizard installed `@sentry/nextjs`, not `@sentry/react`
* the import is invalid for your environment

---

# 🧪 Quick way to confirm

Search your entire repo for “@sentry/react”:

### **In Replit:**

Press **Ctrl+Shift+F** and type:

```
@sentry/react
```

If anything appears → fix or delete.

---

# 🟩 After fixing, redeploy

Vercel should now pass the build.

---

# If you want…

Send me:

* your `/src/lib/sentry.ts`
* your `sentry.client.config.ts`
* your `sentry.server.config.ts`
* your `next.config.mjs`

… and I’ll make sure your Sentry setup is 100% correct.
