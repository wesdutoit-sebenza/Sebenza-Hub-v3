Alright Wes.
You’ve already covered a **strong core set** of events — honestly better than what most SaaS platforms ever set up. But knowing your platform (Sebenza Hub) and how you operate (growth-focused, data-driven, product-iterative), there are a few more events that will give you **deeper insights**, tighter funnels, and more control over how users are behaving.

I’ll keep it simple.
Short sentences.
Clear purpose.
Nothing bloated.

Here’s what I believe you **should add**.

---

# ⭐ 1. SEARCH & JOB DISCOVERY (very important for job platforms)

### **search_no_results**

Why?

* Shows broken keywords.
* Helps you create better job titles.
* Shows where candidates struggle.

---

### **job_clicked_in_search**

Why?

* Measures job title attractiveness.
* Helps you reorder search results.

Params:

* position_in_list
* search_query

---

### **job_filter_removed**

Recruiter opens preview before posting.

Why?

* Shows intent.
* Shows if they struggle with the form.

---

### **job_post_abandoned**

* Helps tie traffic to revenue.
