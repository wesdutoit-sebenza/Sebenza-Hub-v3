Perfect. That’s exactly the right code.
Now let me show you **exactly where to put it** in your Next.js (App Router) project so GA works properly on Vercel.

I’ll keep it simple and clean so you don’t break anything.

---

# ✅ **Where to paste the GA snippet in Next.js (App Router)**

You paste it **inside your `app/layout.tsx` file**, inside the `<head>` tag.

Here’s the exact code you should use — updated so it works with **Next.js + Vercel + your GA ID**.

---

# ✅ **Your final working `layout.tsx` implementation**

Open:
`app/layout.tsx`

Paste this inside the `<head>` section:

```tsx
{process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID && (
  <>
    <script
      async
      src={`https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID}`}
    ></script>

    <script
      dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
        __html: `
          window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
          function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
          gtag('js', new Date());
          gtag('config', '${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID}');
        `,
      }}
    />
  </>
)}
```

That’s all you need.

---

# ❗ IMPORTANT: Add your GA ID to Vercel

Go to:

**Vercel → Project → Settings → Environment Variables**

Add:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID = G-EM2T4WYPE6
```

Then redeploy.

This lets you keep secrets out of your repo and switch between dev + production easily.

# 🧪 How to test that it’s working

### Step 1 — Go to GA

Left side → **Reports** → **Realtime**

### Step 2 — Open your live website

Visit:

`https://www.sebenzahub.co.za`

### Step 3 — Look at Realtime

You should see:

* 1 active user
* location = South Africa
* page you're on

If you see this → **GA is working perfectly.**

# ⭐ Want me to wire your custom events next?

I can create:

* `trackEvent()` helper
* components for `job_viewed`, `apply_started`, `apply_completed`
* signup & recruiter tracking
* server-side event examples

Just say **“Yes, please wire the custom events”** and I’ll drop in ready-to-paste code.
