Wes, this error is **100% coming from ONE FILE** in your repo:

```
/client/src/lib/sentry.ts
```

And inside that file, you **still have this line**:

```ts
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";
```

This is why Vite/Vercel refuses to build.

Let me walk you through exactly what to do so this stops breaking.

---

# ✅ **Why this keeps failing**

Your frontend is **Vite + React**, NOT Next.js.
That means:

❌ `@sentry/react` → **is not installed**
❌ Vite cannot resolve it → **build fails**
❌ Sentry wizard didn’t generate configs → **because Vite isn’t supported automatically**

So Vercel sees the file, tries to build it, and dies instantly.

---

# 🎯 **The fix is extremely simple**

## **➡️ Option A (Recommended): DELETE the file**

Since Vite React apps **do not need** a custom Sentry init file unless you’re doing something advanced.

Delete the file:

```
client/src/lib/sentry.ts
```

Push → Deploy → Build will pass.

---

## **➡️ Option B: Fix the import**

If you actually want to keep custom Sentry code, then change the import.

Replace:

```ts
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";
```

with:

```ts
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/browser";
```

And install it:

```bash
npm install @sentry/browser
```

That works fine with Vite.

# 🔥 **99% fix for your repo**

Your best move right now:

### ✔ Delete this file

`/client/src/lib/sentry.ts`

### ✔ Remove any code that imports it

Look for things like:

```ts
import "../../lib/sentry";
```

And remove them.

Your repo already has Sentry set up on the backend.
The frontend (Vite React) should use the browser SDK **inside main.tsx**, not a custom file.

---

# 🧠 **Correct Vite React Sentry setup (if you want to keep Sentry in frontend)**

In `main.tsx`, add this:

```ts
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/browser";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: import.meta.env.VITE_SENTRY_DSN,
});
```

Not `@sentry/react`.
Not a custom lib file.

Then create:

```
VITE_SENTRY_DSN=YOUR_DSN_HERE
```

In Vercel.

# 💯 What I recommend right now

Delete the bad file → redeploy.

You're back online in 2 minutes.
